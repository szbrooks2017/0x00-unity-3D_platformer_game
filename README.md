In the Options button the user can set and apply changes to the background music and SFX noises. They can also invert the y-axis if they are used to that. Created with built in Unity buttons and sliders. 


![Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szbrooks2017/0x00-unity-3D_platformer_game/main/Assets/Readme%20Assets/UI_options_clicked.gif) 

There is a back button that returns to the previous canvas.


![Pause Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szbrooks2017/0x00-unity-3D_platformer_game/main/Assets/Readme%20Assets/Pause%20Menu.png) 

The pause menu is activated from in game by hitting `esc` and is modeled after the previous screen game objects. When the pause menu is active, the background music is muffled and the time is paused.
